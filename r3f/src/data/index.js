        Niloom AI is an innovative platform empowering creators to produce,
        share, and experience AR/VR projects. As the lead developer of the
        Player App, I spearheaded efforts to enhance the user experience by
        enabling users to explore, comment on, and reward projects seamlessly.
        Built as an embedded browser app using Next.js& TypeScript, the Player
        App employs @tanstack/react-query for optimal performance and data
        caching.

        <br />
        I am currently developing a Preview Feature using Three.js and R3F,
        allowing users to view immersive projects directly in the browser. This
        feature bridges the gap between browser accessibility and XR device
        compatibility, offering a versatile, user-friendly solution.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beyond the Player App, I designed and launched Niloom‚Äôs landing page
        using Webflow. I coordinated with design and marketing teams to deliver
        a polished, responsive landing page.

        This portfolio is an interactive and immersive showcase of my personal
        and professional journey. Built as a dynamic mini-world with Three.js,
        R3F, and Next.js, users control an avatar to explore portals that reveal
        modals featuring my experience, projects, and contact information. Each

        Initially created using vanilla Three.js and JavaScript, the portfolio
        was later rebuilt entirely with React-Three-Fiber (R3F). This process

        environment, a skillset I leveraged in my professional role at Niloom.

        The Nasa API project is a personal backend-focused endeavor that
        catalogs all SpaceX rocket launches since 2006 while enabling users to
        schedule and manage fictional rocket launches. These launches target
        planets within the habitable zone around other stars, based on data from
        NASA‚Äôs Kepler mission. Scheduled launches are stored in a persistent
        MongoDB database and dynamically updated across the Upcoming Launches
        and History pages as their status changes.

        This project leverages Node.js and Express for building the server,

        server to a MongoDB cluster with well-defined database schemas. I also

        Jablonkowy Las is a website designed for a charming summer resort in the

        Built with Gatsby and GraphQL, the website leverages modern web
        technologies to deliver a fast and cost-efficient experience. The
        integration of i18next ensures seamless internationalization, making the
        site accessible to a broader audience.

        As my first professional freelance project, I was responsible for the
        entire process‚Äîfrom design to deployment. I collaborated with the client
        to transform their vision from Figma designs into a functional,

        appreciating GraphQL‚Äôs ability to load only the necessary data for each

        Built with WordPress, PHP, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, the site
